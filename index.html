<p>	This is just a repo to hold my book aimed at bright 12-13 year
	old girls learning algebra, <a href="./MariaAndTheMathFairies.pdf">Maria and the Math Fairies</a>.

<p> I set out to write the "best" book I could---by which I mean a book that would teach as much as possible. It is not easy to make algebra exciting---but it is important.

<p> I'd love for some child to read this book. I wrote it for my daughter, but she has outgrown it.

<p> WARNING: This book is squarely aimed at young girls. However, it does have crippling, murder, betrayal, magic and sorcery, as well as something far worse---teens being cruel to each other.

<p> NOTE: My email address is wrong in the manuscript, I now use <mailto:read.robert@gmail.com>.
