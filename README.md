Maria And The Math Faries
=====================

This is just a repo to hold my book aimed at bright 12-13 year old girls learning algebra, "Maria and the Math Fairies".

I set out to write the "best" book I could---by which I mean a book that would teach as much as possible.  It is not
easy to make algebra exciting---but it is important.

I'd love for some child to read this book.  I wrote it for my daughter, but she has outgrown it.

WARNING: This book is squarely aimed at young girls.  However, it does have crippling, murder, betrayal, magic 
and sorcery, as well as something far worse---teens being cruel to each other.
